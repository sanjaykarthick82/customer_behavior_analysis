Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Visualization

Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from data ingestion and exploration to database querying and interactive visualization.
The objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw data using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present them in a clear and decision-oriented manner.
This project highlights skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and dashboard reporting, making it suitable for data analyst and business intelligence roles.

Dataset

Source: CSV dataset (local file)
Type: Structured, tabular data
Content: Contains customer/business-related attributes used for analytical insights
Size: Medium-scale dataset suitable for analytics and reporting

The dataset is first analyzed using Python and then loaded into a relational database for SQL-based analysis.

Tools & Technologies
Programming: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
SQL: Data querying, filtering, aggregation
Visualization: Power BI
Reporting: Power BI report & analytical summary

Project Workflow / Steps
1. Data Loading (Python)
Imported dataset using Pandas
Verified data structure, data types, and schema

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships
Identified missing values and outliers
Generated summary statistics and visualizations

3. Data Cleaning
Handled missing and inconsistent values
Removed duplicates
Standardized column formats and data types

4. Database Integration
Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
Created tables using SQLAlchemy / native SQL
Verified successful data insertion

5. SQL Analysis
Performed analytical queries using SQL:
Filtering and sorting
Aggregations and grouping
Business-driven insights extraction

6. Power BI Dashboard
Connected Power BI to the database
Built interactive dashboards with:
KPIs and summary metrics
Charts and trend analysis
Filters and slicers for dynamic exploration

7. Report Creation
Compiled insights into a structured report
Highlighted key trends, patterns, and recommendations
Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
High-level KPIs for quick insights
Interactive charts for trend analysis
Drill-down capabilities for detailed exploration
Clean and recruiter-friendly layout
The dashboard is designed to support data-driven decision making.


Results & Insights
Identified key patterns and trends from the dataset
Converted raw data into actionable insights
Demonstrated how Python, SQL, and BI tools work together in a real-world analytics pipeline
